## Power Flow
- [Benchmarks for OPF Problem](https://github.com/power-grid-lib/pglib-opf) - 
This benchmark library is curated and maintained by the IEEE PES Task Force on Benchmarks for Validation of Emerging Power System Algorithms and is designed to evaluate a well established version of the the AC Optimal Power Flow problem. 
- [PyPSA](https://github.com/PyPSA/PyPSA) - PyPSA stands for "Python for Power System Analysis". It is pronounced "pipes-ah".

## Production Cost Modeling
- [PyPSA](https://github.com/PyPSA/PyPSA) - PyPSA stands for "Python for Power System Analysis". It is pronounced "pipes-ah".
- [Plexos](https://energyexemplar.com/products/plexos-simulation-software/) - Plexos uses mathematical multi-commodity optimization to provide a high-performance, robust simulation system for electric power, water and gas.
- [AuroraXMP](https://energyexemplar.com/products/aurora-simulation-software/) - Aurora is a comprehensive and reliable electricity price forecasting and analysis tool. 

## Simulation Tool
- [OpenDSS](http://smartgrid.epri.com/SimulationTool.aspx) - The OpenDSS is a comprehensive electrical power system simulation tool primarly for electric utility power distribution systems. It supports nearly all frequency domain (sinusoidal steady‐state) analyses commonly performed on electric utility power distribution systems. In addition, it supports many new types of analyses that are designed to meet future needs related to smart grid, grid modernization, and renewable energy research. 
- [PowerWorld](https://www.powerworld.com/) - PowerWorld's wide range of products provide the tools needed by transmission planners, power marketers, system operators and trainers, educators, and anyone else desiring access to power system information and analysis in a user-friendly format.

## Data
- [Reliability Test System](https://github.com/GridMod/RTS-GMLC) - Reliability Test System - Grid Modernization Lab Consortium
- [pyiso](https://github.com/WattTime/pyiso) - pyiso provides Python client libraries for ISO and other power grid data sources. It powers the WattTime API (https://api.watttime.org/), among other things.
- [PowerSystems.jl](https://github.com/NREL/PowerSystems.jl) - Data structures in Julia to enable power systems analysis

## Modeling & Optimization
- [JuMP](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl) - Modeling language for Mathematical Optimization (linear, mixed-integer, conic, semidefinite, nonlinear)
- [StructJuMP](https://github.com/StructJuMP/StructJuMP.jl) - A block-structured optimization framework for JuMP
- [Pyomo]()
- [Pyomo](http://www.pyomo.org/) - Pyomo is a Python-based, open-source optimization modeling language with a diverse set of optimization capabilities.
- [Gams](https://www.gams.com/) - The General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) is a high-level modeling system for mathematical optimization. GAMS is designed for modeling and solving linear, nonlinear, and mixed-integer optimization problems.
